Yam is a basic, simple, concise mapping tool.

I've been using .NET mapping tools (e.g. AutoMapper) for years, but I often find the existing tools to be too complex, 
too verbose, too feature rich. Most of the time I just want a simple tool to do simple mappings with a simple, concise 
syntax. This is my attempt at such a tool.
